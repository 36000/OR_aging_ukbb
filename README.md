# OR aging in UKBB

Code used for data processing and figure generation in "Optic radiations representing different eccentricities age differently"

This code assumes that you have .zip files from the UKBiobank (UKBB) containing their dMRI data. It also assumes
you have a CSV containing subject information like age or sex.

Start with the README in the afq_processing folder then move onto the README in the analysis_and_figures folder for instructions.
